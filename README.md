About Dataset
Overview This report analyses a wide sales dataset of 9,994 records and 22 attributes, capturing key characteristics including, but not limited to, sales figures, profits, discounts, quantities, and detailed customer and product information. The key metrics include total sales ranging from 0.44 to $22,638.48, with an average of $229.86, and profit ranging from a loss of - $6,599.98 to a gain of $8,399.98, averaging $28.66. The dataset also contains temporal and geographic information, including the dates of order and ship, postal codes, and regional classifications that help reach deeper insights into trend and pattern analyses.
The most important objectives of the present analysis are to find out underlying patterns in sales performance and profitability, understand the effectiveness of discounts and quantity sold on profit margins, and identify regional and categorical trends using higher-order clustering and regression techniques. The statistical measures show large variability in sales and profits, indicating outliers and diverse market behaviours. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and clustering diagrams will be used in this report to provide actionable insights that will help in strategic decision-making toward enhancing sales effectiveness and optimizing profit margins.
